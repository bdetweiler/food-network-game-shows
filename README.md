# food-network-game-shows
I have a hypothesis that there are clues in Food Network game shows Cutthroat Kitchen and Chopped 
that indicate who will get sent home and who will win. Here, we test that.

Visual indications I will examine include pre-commercial teasers and who the judge looks at.

I will gather data on this by watching Seasons 1 - 4 of Cutthroat Kitchen, which has 13 episodes each for a total of 
47 episodes. 

Later, I may come back to Chopped.
